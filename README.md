# RecipeBox
<hr>
<strong>Store and access your favorite recipes with this Django-based creation</strong>

Up high in my mother's cupboard is an overstuffed recipe box.  In it, you can find 3x5 index cards
with cramped handwriting detailing the recipes for Grandma's Hot Chocolate, Susan's Green Bean Casserole,
and the family's favorite Peanut Butter Cookies.  These treasured recipes are long overdue for a digital
update!  Putting these recipes in a database like RecipeBox allows you to easily sort through, modify, 
and share your favorites.

<strong>RecipeBox features:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>The index page lists all titles of the loaded recipes.</li>
  <li>Each title is a link that takes you to a single page with the content of that recipe.</li>
  <li>Each detail view for a recipe has the author name, along with all the information for 
    the recipe arranged in a reasonable format.</li>
  <li>Clicking on the author's name takes you to an Author Detail page, where you can see 
    a list of all the recipes that Author has contributed to.</li>
  <li>You must be signed in to make additions or changes, but recipes are viewable to all.</li>
</ul>

<strong>About this project</strong>
This is my first project in Django. In it, I'm exploring and learning about models, views, urls, 
admin users, using SQLite, migrating, templates, and using the Django template language.  It is
also my first time using Poetry to create a virtual environment.  

Let's get started...
